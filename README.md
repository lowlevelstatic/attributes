Demonstration of Test Driven Development applied to ILayeredAttributes interface

Note - This example does not provide full test coverage of the ILayeredAttributes implementation due to limited time.
Not all enumerated EffectOperations or AttributeKey values are tests, and there are likely untested edge cases.
Also, additional refactoring in both the implementation and unit test class could reduce code duplication.
This example simply uses a test-first approach to drive implementation of classes and methods.
